# Igntion History

## Description

Andon Report is a Node.js application that facilitates the management and visualization of production incidents. The application runs inside a Docker container and uses Nginx as a reverse proxy to redirect traffic to the application on the `/ign_history` path. The application connects to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve incident data, and offers functionalities to search, visualize, and export reports in CSV format.

## Features

- **Incident Visualization**: Allows viewing production incidents filtered by date.
- **Data Export**: Exports incidents to a CSV file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Uses EJS for views and provides an intuitive interface.
- **Deployment with Docker**: Facilitates deployment using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Integration with Nginx**: Uses Nginx as a reverse proxy to manage requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Main platform for running the application.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building the API and handling routes.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing incidents.
- **EJS**: Template engine for rendering server-side views.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application for easy and reproducible deployment.
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy to redirect HTTP traffic to the Node.js application.
